# AlphabetMagic

The "AlphabetsMagic" proyect is a serie of experiments to explore and conquer the new multiverse of Typographic Artificial Intelligence led by Pablo Impallari and open to the participation of those who wish to collaborate.

## The Experiments:
The aim of the experiments is to put into practice what was previously only theory or speculation. The process of experimentation allows us to assess what is possible to do today and define the way forward. It presents us with challenges and motivates us to overcome them. In this way we can improve our skills and gradually overcome more complex objectives.

The methodology consists of defining a specific objective in each experiment, so that we can evaluate it as objectively as possible and provide feedback for the next experiment.

### Experiment 1
The objective of this particular experiment is to generate exiting, cool, flamboyant and exotic alphabets.
We want to test if we can generate creative, eye catching and excentric lettershapes while maintaining consistency with the entire alphabet.
In this experiment we are looking for alphabets that can be used in short words or sentences, we are specificaly avoiding the design charasteristic of typefaces designed for long paraghaps of text. In fact if we get the result looking like Arial or Times New Roman we will consider it as a epic fail.

Here are a few results. There are many more alphabets inside the Experiment folder
