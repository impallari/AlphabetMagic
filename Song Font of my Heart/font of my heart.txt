Font of My Heart

[Verse]
In a room all alone with a screen so bright
They craft the letters that come to light
Lines and curves they fight the fight
Making words dance through the night

[Verse 2]
Eyes on glyphs they never stray
Kerning dreams that never fade away
Serifs bold and clean they play
In a symphony of shades of gray

[Chorus]
Oh the font of my heart it speaks so clear
Every letter every line draws me near
Designers of the night in their typographic sphere
Loving every curve every angle dear

[Verse 3]
Typographers in a world apart
Creating magic with every part
From the baseline to the top chart
With precision that is pure art

[Bridge]
Pausing just to sip caffeine
Pixels move on the glowing screen
In a world where words convene
They make the unseen scene

[Chorus]
Oh the font of my heart it speaks so clear
Every letter every line draws me near
Designers of the night in their typographic sphere
Loving every curve every angle dear
